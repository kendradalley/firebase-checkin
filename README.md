# Firebase-Checkin - sample app for meetup check-ins.

This sample app will demonstrate how design a Firebase app
by:

- Design the server-side data model.
- Secure and validate the model with Rules.
- The Typescript toolchain for node and browser:
  - npm
  - tsc
  - browserify
  - VSCode
- Design the client app interface and local
  application state.
- Implement a UI-less (biz logic) application
  with unit tests.
- Create a simple web app that displays the
  local app state and interacts with the user
  to call UI-less app methods.
